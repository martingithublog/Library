         Hi,<br />
        Here is little info about me. I was born and raised in Sofia, attended technical high school and then studied at TU Sofia.<br /><br />

        &nbsp; When I got my first PC, more than 10 years ago, I started  playing video games. In order to achieve faster development <br />
        I often find miself searching in the web forums for some "hacks". Little that I know at the time that lines of text that I <br />
        added to the game files were actual code/programing. But that wear of after a while and my interest moved into<br />
        hardware (especially sound one).<br /><br />

        &nbsp; Long story short my intrest into programing came back at my previous job, as an electrical constructor, where I was assigned to maintain<br />
        the company records system/portal. At first I was hardly understanding anything, but then it hit me!<br />
        I was "coding" all along that time as a punk kid and I started to dig deeper into it.<br />
        And here I am few months and few courses later on a search for new opportunities and new exciting job!<br /><br />

        Thanks For Your Time And I Hope We Meet Someday!!!  =] <3 <(*_*)^
